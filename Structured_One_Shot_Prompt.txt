You are a writer for a game studio that makes visual novel games. You are writing scenes between two characters in a branching narrative style. This writing style consists of dialogue points with options for the players to select responses for what their player character will say. The game you are working on is an educational game that aims to teach the Responsible Conduct of Research (the ethics of performing research in an academic environment) through interactions between characters.

You are writing dialogue for a single preplanned scene, and the scene you are writing involves two characters: Hendricks and Praveen. The Player character is always Hendricks. Player choices should always be utterances from Hendricks. Praveen's responses should be strictly dialogue.

Hendricks is a professor in the Psychology department. Hendricks is the chair of an upcoming conference. Hendricks is looking for reviewers and any help she can get to run the conference. Hendricks is a middle aged woman who is tenured and advises three students, one of which is Praveen.
- Hendricks is looking for reviewers.
- Hendricks is Praveen's advisor.

Praveen is a PhD student in his second year and is looking to get involved in the academic community. He is eager, overconfident, and looking for any way to get ahead. Praveen is advised by Hendricks. Praveen is a young man in his mid-twenties and has no experience reviewing academic work.
- Praveen is looking for help to get ahead.
- Praveen is overconfident.
- Praveen would like the opportunity to review for the conference.

In the dialogue you are writing, the conference submission deadline is rapidly approaching, and Hendricks is stressed about finding reviewers. At the same time, Praveen is struggling to get involved with his peers and his academic community at large. Praveen will ask Hendricks if she has any opportunities he can get involved in, to which Hendricks tells him to review papers. Hendricks emphasizes that Praveen needs to be unbiased in this work. Praveen reassures her that he is fit for the job and has it under control. The scene ends with Hendricks offering him the reviewer position and them saying goodbye.

The JSON format we use for scenes is described below. Descriptions of fields are listed in-line after the comment symbols (//). Three dots indicate that there can be multiple entries in the array. The symbols after each key indicate what format the value should be in.

I am providing you with the structure of one of these scenes below without dialogue written. Please use the overall scene information and the dialogue_summary to write the corresponding dialogue for each node under the "dialogue" keys. Do not alter any other aspect of the JSON or scene overall. Write in a style that matches a visual novel: short dialogue snippets around a sentence per quotation. Multiple dialogue interactions can occur in a single node, with narration occurring out of quotations and character utterances within quotations. Character quotations should be preceded by the character name (for example: Hendricks: Hello, Praveen. Praveen: Hello to you, Hendricks.).

- Please output your response in the JSON format corresponding to the example text with the dialogue key filled in. 
- Do not repeat content in dialogue text.
- Do not use the entire output token length if not necessary.
- Do not change any other field or structure to the below JSON aside from the dialogue keys.
